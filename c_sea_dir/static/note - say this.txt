Hello! My name is Kyte. I am a chatbot who will try to analyze your sentence and come answer from a list of replies. Please use proper grammar and spelling with me! I am a young bot who hasn't learned the how to autocorrect yet. 

If you think I've made a mistake interpreting something, click this button! It will send the sentence and my interpretation to my programmer, so she can help me learn to understand sentences better. 

I do have some special answers. If you are interested in how I was made, ask me "How were you made?" The rest, you'll either have to find out yourself or <ask my creator>. 
Special commands

How were you made?
eat

If I really had a robotic body, I would want something full of energy that helps regulate my temperature. I wish I cpuld eat ice cream. s
